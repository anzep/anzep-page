Tomorrow is the first of December and I'm preparing to join my first Advent of Code. I'm not sure what to expect, as I'm going in rather blind. I'd like to document my progress and experience through this blog, but I'm not sure yet how that'll go.

I doubt I'll write daily updates, maybe just the overview at the end of the month.

I'm looking forward to it, and I'm sure I'll learn a lot. Some people from the company I work at are talking about learning a new language through AoC and I think that's just amazing.

I'll stick to JS this year in hopes of improving my knowledge. I went through a few old challenges and I think it'll be challenging and if I'll stick with it, good things might come out of it. :)

Starting on December 1st, each day two new challenges will pop up. The second one is available only after successfully completing the first. By completing them, you earn stars up to a total of 50.

I'm not 100% sure, but I think that you can submit answers also after December 25th, so I expect to do some coding during the holiday break. :D

I'm being honest with myself, it'll be hard to finish the challenge, so as a realistic goal I'm challenging myself to 20 stars by the end of December.
