_As the world embraces longer nights, colder winds, misty horizons, and nature takes on the earthy hues, arrives my favorite season. With it, arrives the most sacred night for any horror fan._

♦

It's hard to say why I like Halloween so much. I think it's a combination of all things. It's autumn, everything starts to slow down for the end of the year, it's sweater weather, and evenings are filled (as much as) possible with tea and books.

But most of all, it's the little tradition we set up with a group of my friends. We are nearing a decade of our marathons of food and horror. And another one arrives tonight.

My friend who is hosting us each year is a cook. A damn great cook. So I've been fasting for most of the day. But as he slaved over the stovetop, I was not idle neither.

♦

For years I wished, that I would be able to write beautiful calligraphic letters. My favorite script was always copperplate. It just radiates mystery and class to me. Over the past five or so years, I've been practicing calligraphy and I'm glad to say, I like where I'm at.

So since we always try to make the evening a bit more atmospheric, I figured, we can combine my two interests.
My friend always prepares the movie list, and it's usually grouped into a few topics or subgenres of horror. Then we pick a few topics, he presents the movies and we watch one of them and then move on.

This year he prepared eight categories of two movies each. Well almost. The first movie of the night is already selected.
